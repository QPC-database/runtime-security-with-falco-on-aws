# Workshop Prerequisites

There are a few prerequisite tasks you must perform before getting started on this workshop. These are:

1. Access an AWS account
2. Launch and configure a Cloud9 IDE Workspace
3. *(Optional) In case you want to take Module 5. Using Falco on Fargate you'll need to Sign-up for a Sysdig Trial account.*

We will step through each of these in turn. 


## Access an AWS account
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* [Attending an AWS hosted event]({{< ref "010_prerequisites/14_aws_event_setup" >}}), or
* [Running the workshop on your own]({{< ref "010_prerequisites/16_aws_setup_your_own" >}})

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Launch a Cloud9 IDE Workspace**]({{< ref "010_prerequisites/18_configure_workstation" >}}).

Do not worry about following the right sequence of steps during the workshop. The left menu panel shows you the whole structure of the course. To advance, you just need to click on the right arrow in each lesson to jump to the next step. Left arrow to step back. Finally, you will find in the content of the course inline links to other contents when required, so you don't have to browse to them. ![Navigation](/images/00_introduction/navigation.png)
